# Agent Instructions

## Scope
These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Development Practices
- Follow industry-standard best practices and write clean, professional code.
- Prefer readability, maintainability, and adherence to established patterns in this project.
- Before committing, ensure the project builds successfully and that all automated tests pass.
- When applicable, run the web application and verify there are no console errors or runtime issues.
- Document any important decisions or deviations directly in the relevant files or commit messages.
- Keep dependencies tidy; remove unused packages and avoid unnecessary additions.
- Front-end updates must follow the "Minimalist Organic UI" direction: light neutral backgrounds, generous whitespace, translucent glass surfaces, a restrained accent palette centred on #007AFF, soft motion (cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1)), and typography inspired by SF Pro/Inter with relaxed line spacing.
- Prefer depth via subtle shadows, gradients, or opacity rather than strong borders; hierarchy should rely on spacing, weight, and opacity changes.

## Testing
- Always run the appropriate build command (e.g., `npm run build`) to confirm the project builds without errors.
- Run relevant test suites and linting commands to ensure code quality before completing a task.
- Manually verify that the web interface works as expected when changes may affect the UI.

## Version Control
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages explaining the changes made.
- Ensure commits contain only the necessary modifications related to the task.
